# Reading Study

# Why
I created this small webapp in order to perform a study investigating the efficacy of popular speed reading methods such as suppressing subvocalisation or skimming. I will include this as part of my scientific paper about a subtopic of reading that I am writing at Gymnasium Marktbreit.
The results will be made public after the termination of the study, expectedly at the end of this summer.
